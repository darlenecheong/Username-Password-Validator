# Username-Password-Validator
This Python script validates usernames and passwords based on specific criteria (such as length, character types, and restrictions) and provides a function to generate secure passwords that meet all requirements.

## Context
This project was developed as part of a Python course, focusing on building a system for validating usernames and passwords with secure standards. The objective was to ensure that usernames and passwords meet common security requirements, preventing weak credentials. The username validation function checks factors such as length, character variety (uppercase, lowercase, and digits), and ensures the username does not start or end with a digit. Similarly, the password validation function enforces rules for length, inclusion of uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and special characters. To aid users who struggle to meet these criteria, the system also includes a password generator feature. This project serves as an exercise in applying Python to solve real-world security challenges by creating a tool that ensures user credentials are both secure and easy to manage.

## Analysis and Results
The username and password validation functions effectively met the security requirements outlined. The username validation checks for length, character variety (uppercase, lowercase, digits), alphanumeric characters, and restrictions on starting/ending with digits. The function accurately flagged invalid usernames, considering the username requirements.

The password validation function ensured passwords were at least 8 characters long, contained uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and special characters. It also prevented the inclusion of the username within the password. For example, passwords like "pword123" were flagged for missing special characters, while "Pword123!" was accepted. Additionally, the system offered an option to generate a random password if the user's input didnâ€™t meet the requirements, helping users create secure passwords easily.

However, the password generator occasionally produced predictable results. Future improvements could include a more robust password generation algorithm. Additionally, the system could benefit from supporting usernames with special characters and implementing advanced security measures such as password expiration or multi-factor authentication. These adjustments would make the system more secure and versatile in real-world applications.
